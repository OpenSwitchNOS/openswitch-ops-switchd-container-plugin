## Port Configuration in Different VLAN Modes

##  Port in access VLAN mode

### Objective for port in access VLAN mode
The test case checks whether the OpenSwitch OVS is able to drive the Internal "ASIC" OVS and set the configurations correctly in both of the OVS's. The ports in Access mode get configured only when a corresponding VLAN is added. If the VLAN gets deleted, the respective ports with matching tags get deleted from the internal OVS. The following test cases verify ping traffic in different configurations.

### Requirements for port in access VLAN mode
- Virtual Mininet test setup
- **CT File**: ops-switchd-container-plugin/tests/test\_switchd\_container\_ct\_vlan\_access.py

## Sampled Flow
### Objective for sFlow
The test case checks whether sFlow gets successfully configured in the ASIC OVS through OpenSwitch CLI.
It also verifies if the configuration gets correctly written to the "hsflowd" daemon which is responsible for sending samples and statistics to the collector.

### Requirements for sFlow
- Virtual Mininet test setup
- **CT File**: ops-switchd-container-plugin/tests/test\_switchd\_container\_ct\_sflow.py


### Setup topology diagram for sFlow
Single switch topology
```ditaa
+-------------+
|             |
|    Switch   |
|             |
|             |
+-------------+

```
### Test Case for sFlow
#### Description of Test Case for sFlow
1. Configure an interface with IP address and bring it up
2. Enable sflow globally
3. Configure sFlow sampling rate, polling interval, agent interface and collector IP address as shown below
```
switch(config)# interface 1
switch(config-if)# ip address 10.10.10.1/24
switch(config-if)# no shutdown
switch(config-if)# exit
switch(config)# sflow enable
switch(config)# sflow sampling 100
switch(config)# sflow agent-interface 1
switch(config)# sflow collector 10.10.10.2
switch(config)# sflow polling 10
```
Verify the correct setting of the sFlow configuration in the ASIC OVS using the following command
```
/opt/openvswitch/bin/ovs-vsctl list sFlow
```
Also, verify if the configuration is correctly written in hsflowd daemon configuration file
```
cat /etc/hsflowd.conf
```
#### Test result criteria for sFlow
##### Test pass criteria for sFlow
The sFlow configuration set through CLI should be seen in ASIC OVS as communication between switch and other devices happens through ASIC OVS.
The same configuration should also be seen in "hsflowd.conf" file as it is responsible to send samples and other statistics to the right collector with configured sampling and polling rates.
Correct setting of configuration at both the places ensures smooth functionality of sFlow.

##### Test fail criteria for sFlow
Failure in setting of sFlow configuration in ASIC OVS or hsflowd.conf file results in unpredictable functionality of sFlow and irregular processing by collector.
